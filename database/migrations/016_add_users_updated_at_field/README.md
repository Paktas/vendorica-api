# Migration 016: Add Users Updated At Field

## Overview
This migration adds the missing `updated_at` timestamp field to the `users` table. This field is essential for auditing and tracking when user records are modified.

## Problem
Users were getting database errors when editing profiles because the application expected an `updated_at` field that didn't exist in the database.

## Solution
- Adds `updated_at` column with `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` type
- Creates automatic trigger to update the timestamp on record updates
- Initializes existing records with current timestamp
- Uses conditional logic to be safe to run multiple times

## Changes
1. **Column Addition**: `updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()`
2. **Trigger Function**: Ensures `update_updated_at_column()` function exists
3. **Trigger Creation**: `update_users_updated_at` trigger for automatic updates
4. **Data Migration**: Sets current timestamp for existing records

## Safety
- Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` checks to prevent errors if column already exists
- Safe to run multiple times without side effects
- Includes verification steps to confirm successful application

## Impact
- Fixes user profile editing functionality
- Enables proper audit tracking for user record changes
- Maintains consistency with other tables that have `updated_at` fields

## Rollback
The down migration safely removes the column and trigger if needed, though this is not recommended in production as it would break user editing functionality.
