# Migration 011: Remove Legacy Audit Triggers

## Overview
This migration removes old database triggers that were creating duplicate audit trail entries without IP address tracking.

## Problem
The database had legacy triggers from archive files that were automatically creating audit entries with descriptions like "DELETE users record in public" without IP addresses, while the application-level audit logging was creating proper entries with IP tracking and descriptive messages.

## Solution
- Remove all legacy audit triggers (`audit_users`, `audit_vendors`, etc.)
- Remove the `log_audit_trail()` function
- Keep application-level audit logging in services with IP tracking

## Changes Made

### Triggers Removed:
- `audit_users` on `users` table
- `audit_vendors` on `vendors` table  
- `audit_contracts` on `contracts` table
- `audit_framework_fields` on `framework_fields` table
- `audit_framework_field_assignments` on `framework_field_assignments` table

### Functions Removed:
- `log_audit_trail()` trigger function

## Impact
- ✅ Eliminates duplicate audit entries
- ✅ All audit logging now includes IP addresses
- ✅ Consistent audit descriptions from service layer
- ✅ No data loss - only removes redundant triggers

## Verification
After running this migration, verify:
1. No duplicate audit entries are created for CRUD operations
2. All new audit entries have IP addresses
3. Audit descriptions are descriptive (e.g., "Deleted user: email@domain.com")

## Rollback
The down.sql will restore the triggers if needed, but this will re-introduce duplicate logging.
